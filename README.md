# HTML-Example-Repo

This is my website about birds. It talks about peacocks, eagles, and penguins.

## This is how it works:

This page uses a few different HTML elements to structure the content and make it more readable. The <h1> and <h2> elements are used to create headings, the <p> element is used for paragraphs, and the <ul> (Activating the list) and <li> (Each point) elements are used to create a bulleted list. Additionally, the <strong> element is used to bold the names of different types of birds in the list.
  
If you are still unsure what each element does, check out [this cheatsheet](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html/modules/learn-html-elements/cheatsheet)
